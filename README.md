# whatsapp-web-scraper
An automated tool to scrape whatsapp messages and save them in a near similar format to the exported chat .txt file

## requirements (tested on python 3.6)
- jupyter notebook
- selenium
- chrome webdriver (provided the version i used here for future reference)

## instructions
- download or clone repository onto your PC

- if you have jupyter notebook, great! if you don't install it via pip
``` pip install jupyter```

- install selenium via pip
``` pip install selenium```

- open the notebook and execute the steps from there (might take a while depending on number of chats)

- when the app is done, a folder named **wa_chats** should be created in the folder where your notebook is with the chats inside as .txt files
